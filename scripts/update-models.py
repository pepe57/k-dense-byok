"""Regenerate web/src/data/models.json from the live OpenRouter catalogue.

Usage: python3 scripts/update-models.py

Inclusion rules: every OpenRouter model that
  - supports tool calling (`supported_parameters` contains "tools"),
  - has non-negative pricing (the Auto Router advertises -1 as a
    "variable pricing" sentinel, which would corrupt the spend-cap
    accrual in server/src/agent/models.ts), and
  - was released on OpenRouter within the last MAX_AGE_MONTHS (`created`
    timestamp) — the catalogue stays current instead of accumulating
    every legacy model, and old models tend to hit tool-calling compat
    bugs anyway. `~vendor/*-latest` aliases are exempt from the age gate
    because they always redirect to the newest model in their family.

The `default` / `expertDefault` flags are carried forward from the
existing file by model id; a flagged model is kept even past the age
cutoff (dropping the app's default would break new chats), and the
script warns if one has disappeared from OpenRouter entirely. Models
named by a shipped Fusion preset are pinned the same way — see
fusion_preset_models().
