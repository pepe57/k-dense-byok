# Basic usage

This guide covers everything you need for day-to-day work with Kady, your AI research assistant. It assumes you've already [installed the app](./installation.md) and have it open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Your first session

1. **Create a project.** Each project is a self-contained workspace with its own files, chat history, and settings. Think of one project per study, paper, or analysis.
2. **Upload your data** (optional). Drag files into the file browser on the left, or drop them directly onto the message box. CSVs, PDFs, notebooks, genomics tables, molecular structures, mass spectra, imaging volumes — [60+ scientific formats](./file-previews.md) are recognized and previewable.
3. **Ask for what you want in plain language.** For example:
   - *"Run a differential expression analysis on counts.csv comparing treated vs control, and plot a volcano plot."*
   - *"Summarize the methods sections of these three PDFs and compare their statistical approaches."*
   - *"Find recent literature on CRISPR off-target prediction and write a one-page overview with citations."*

Kady works like a researcher at a computer: it reads and writes files, runs code, searches the web, and reports back. You'll see its progress live in the chat, and any files it produces appear in the file browser, ready to preview or download.

## How Kady works on a task

- **It asks before it assumes.** When a task is ambiguous, Kady pauses and shows an interactive question form right in the chat — multiple choice with recommended answers, free text, even image upload. Confirm its suggestions in one click or skip the form entirely.
- **It runs real code.** Analyses happen in your project's sandbox using Python (managed automatically with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)). You can ask to see the code, modify it, or re-run it.
- **It activates the right skills.** 140+ pre-installed scientific skills cover genomics, proteomics, drug discovery, materials science, and more. Kady picks the relevant ones automatically — you don't need to choose.
- **It can delegate to specialists.** Kady has a built-in team of 21 scientific sub-agents — a `citation-checker` that verifies every reference, a `statistical-reviewer` that audits your analysis, a `peer-reviewer` that writes a journal-style report, and 18 more. Kady delegates on its own for heavy or parallel work, or you can name one yourself: *"have the citation-checker go through manuscript.md"*. See [Sub-agents](./sub-agents.md).
- **It can search the web and read sources.** Kady (and every sub-agent) can search the web, fetch and read pages, PDFs, and entire GitHub repositories, and even understand YouTube videos — out of the box, no extra key required. Optional Exa, Perplexity, and Gemini keys unlock the direct providers (see [Installation → Optional API keys](./installation.md#6-optional-api-keys)).
- **It presents structured scientific results.** Meaningful tables, statistical tests, plots, quality-control checks, dataset schemas, citations, molecules, and artifact bundles can appear as typed cards in the chat. Plot and file cards link to the underlying sandbox artifacts, so you can open the complete result in the center preview. These cards structure values reported by the agent; they are not an independent verification pass.

## The interface

Kady's workspace has three columns: the **file browser** on the left, the **file preview / editor** in the center, and the **chat** on the right. Drag the dividers between columns to resize them. The two panel buttons in the header (next to the Settings gear) collapse the left and right panels independently — each button is highlighted while its panel is open — so you can give the center pane the full window width. That's especially useful when writing LaTeX or studying a large figure. Your choice is remembered across restarts, and a hidden chat keeps running in the background.

### Chat tabs — up to 10 parallel chats

Click `+` in the chat tab strip to open a new chat in the same project. Each tab keeps its own message history, model choice, attached files, and cost meter — but all tabs share the project's files, so results from one chat are immediately available in the others. Tabs keep working in the background while you switch between them. Double-click a tab title to rename it; closing a tab cancels any work it had running.

### Choosing a model

Use the model dropdown in the input bar. Any message can use a tool-capable model from OpenRouter (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, Qwen, and more), a connected Pi OAuth provider, [NVIDIA NIM](./model-selection.md#nvidia-nim-models) (Nemotron, Llama, GPT-OSS, and more with a build.nvidia.com API key), or a free local model through [Ollama](./local-models-ollama.md). To add direct subscription models, open **Settings → Model providers** and connect ChatGPT Plus/Pro, Claude Pro/Max, GitHub Copilot, or xAI through the browser, device-code, or manual flow shown. The lead agent and its specialists share that Kady login. Different tabs can use different models. See [Model selection](./model-selection.md) for model refs and billing behavior.

### Files

- **Upload:** drag files into the file browser or onto the input bar.
- **Reference:** type `@filename` in a message to point Kady at a specific file.
- **Preview:** click any file for a built-in viewer — code, Markdown (with math and diagrams), CSVs, PDFs, images, and Jupyter notebooks, plus a broad set of scientific formats: genomics (FASTA/FASTQ, VCF, BED/GFF/SAM, alignments, phylogenetic trees), chemistry (SMILES/MOL/SDF 2D depictions, interactive 3D PDB/mmCIF structures), mass spectra (mzML/MGF/JCAMP), data arrays (AnnData, HDF5, Parquet, NumPy, NetCDF), and bio-imaging (DICOM, NIfTI, TIFF). See the [full list](./file-previews.md).
- **Download:** grab any result straight from the file browser.

### Workflow templates

Open the workflows panel to browse **326 ready-to-run templates across 22 disciplines** — genomics, drug discovery, finance, astrophysics, and more. Pick one, fill in the blanks, and click Launch; it runs in the currently active chat tab. Want to add your own? See [Contributing workflows](./contributing-workflows.md).

### Remote compute jobs

After adding a Modal token pair in **Settings → API keys**, use the compute
picker beside the composer to choose a cloud CPU or GPU. Short `modal_run` jobs
block the current agent turn, while durable jobs can run in the background,
survive a backend restart, and be inspected or cancelled from the center-panel
**Compute** tab. Inputs are validated before upload, outputs are installed
atomically into the local sandbox, and estimated spend is reserved against the
project cap before resources start. See [Durable Modal compute](./modal-compute.md).

### Scientific databases

Kady can query **229 scientific and financial databases** across 18 categories — Biomedical & Health, Chemistry & Materials, Scholarly Publications, Stock Market, Earth & Climate, Astronomy & Space, and more. Just ask (*"look up this compound in PubChem"*); Kady knows how to reach them. A few databases need their own free API key, listed in `.env.example`.

### LaTeX editor

Open any `.tex` file and click **Edit** for a split-pane editor with live PDF compilation. It includes a choice of engine (pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, LuaLaTeX), a section outline with click-to-jump, forward and inverse SyncTeX (jump between a source line and its spot in the PDF), autocomplete and spell check, a compile log with inline error and warning diagnostics, quick-insert snippets, and a word count. AI assist is built in: press `Cmd/Ctrl+K` to rewrite a selection from an instruction, or click **Fix with AI** on a compile error — each change lands as a diff you can keep or revert. Collapse the file browser and chat (the panel buttons in the header) to give the editor and PDF the full window.

### Other input options

- **Voice input** — dictate your message instead of typing. Browser-native speech needs no model credential; the server-side fallback remains OpenRouter-only.
- **Message queue** — keep typing while Kady works; up to 5 messages queue and run in order.

## Costs and budgets

The cost pill in the header shows the active tab's session spend (`sess`) and the project total across every tab (`proj`), with token details in its popover. You can set an optional hard spend cap per project in Settings.

- OpenRouter pay-as-you-go and Anthropic OAuth's Pi-documented metered extra per-token usage count toward the cap.
- OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, and xAI subscription runs track tokens and a list-price reference, but do not treat that reference as project spend. Their quotas and overages are managed by the provider, so this does not mean the usage is free or unlimited. NVIDIA NIM gets the same treatment: it bills NVIDIA-managed API credits rather than per-token dollars, so Kady records tokens without counting USD spend.
- Local Ollama usage does not add model spend. Modal compute remains separately estimated and counted.

## Settings

Click the gear icon in the top-right to:

- connect supported subscriptions under **Model providers**,
- manage your **API keys**,
- connect external tools via **[MCP servers](./mcp-servers.md)** — GitHub, reference managers, databases, and hundreds more, with a built-in connection tester,
- view, edit, and create **[sub-agents](./sub-agents.md)**,
- change the appearance.

## Tips for good results

- **Give context.** "Analyze my data" works, but "Compare expression between the 3 treated and 3 control samples in counts.csv; genes are rows" works much better.
- **Work iteratively.** Ask for a first pass, look at the output, then refine — just like working with a colleague.
- **Use projects to stay organized.** One project per paper or study keeps files and chat history together.
- **Check the rough edges.** This is a beta — see [Known limitations](./limitations.md) for what to watch out for.
