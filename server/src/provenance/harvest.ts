/**
 * Reconstruct provenance for work a SUBAGENT did, from its session JSONL.
 *
 * A child `pi` process records every tool call it makes as an assistant
 * `toolCall` block, paired with a `toolResult` row carrying `isError`. The parent
 * learns each child's session file on completion — the same hook
 * notebook-harvest and usageFromSessionFile already use — so the calls can be
 * replayed into steps after the fact.
 *
 * WHAT AFTER-THE-FACT COSTS US. The lead agent's recorder sees the sandbox
 * before and after each call, so it can both attribute a file to a step and hash
 * what that step produced. Neither is available here:
 *
 *   - `write`/`edit` name their path, so the edge itself stands on the execution
 *     record (the tool ran, on that path, and did not error). But the bytes are
 *     hashed now, not then, so every harvested ref is marked
 *     `identityAt: "harvest"` and staleness refuses to call it "current".
 *     `change` is `"wrote"` rather than created/modified, which would be a guess.
 *   - `bash` is opaque and there is no snapshot to diff, so it gets no edges and
 *     is marked `degraded: "no-scan-baseline"` — the gap is recorded instead of
 *     being reported as "this step wrote nothing".
 *
 * To keep script-written outputs from vanishing entirely, `inferOutputs` offers
 * mtime-window attribution as an explicitly `inferred` edge. See its comment for
 * the filter and the false-positive it can still make.
 *
 * Pure + defensive: unreadable file, malformed row, or unknown shape is skipped.

/**
 * Attribute unclaimed, in-window sandbox files to a harvested child step.
 *
 * Without this a subagent that runs a script leaves no trace of its outputs at
 * all — and "no recorded provenance" on a figure the agent really did produce
 * reads as a verified absence, which is worse than an honest guess. So: any
 * user-visible file whose mtime falls inside the child's activity window and
 * which NO recorded step already claims is attached to the child's last opaque
 * call, as `inferred`.
 *
 * `claimedPaths` is what keeps this from double-attributing. For a synchronous
 * subagent the lead executes no tools while it runs, so an unclaimed in-window
 * file is almost certainly the child's. For an async child the lead runs
 * concurrently, but its own scan-diffs will already have claimed anything it
 * touched, so those paths are excluded here.
 *
 * The residual false positive: an async child's window overlapping a file
 * written by a DIFFERENT async child. Both would be candidates and the file is
 * attributed to whichever is harvested first. `inferred` is doing real work in
 * this function — do not promote these edges.
