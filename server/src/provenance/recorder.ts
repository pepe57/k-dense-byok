/**
 * Observational provenance recorder.
 *
 * Subscribes to the same Pi event stream the SSE mapper reads (see the
 * `session.subscribe` call in api/sessions.ts) and turns each tool call into a
 * durable step row binding that call to the sandbox files it actually read and
 * wrote. Nothing here trusts the model's account of its own work.
 *
 * Attribution per tool class:
 *
 *   write/edit      the tool names its path and we hash the bytes afterward
 *                   -> `observed`
 *   bash, subagent  only a before/after scan can see what a script wrote
 *                   -> `observed`, downgraded to `inferred` when the drain fell
 *                      behind (see LAG below)
 *   read            the tool names its path -> `observed` input edge
 *   everything else recorded as a step with no file edges
 *
 * LAG: the drain is async so a stat walk never blocks the event handler — a
 * blocked handler stalls SSE for every tab in the project. The queue is FIFO and
 * serialized, so scans stay ordered, but if two tool calls finish before the
 * first one's scan runs, that scan sees both sets of changes. We detect exactly
 * that condition (work still queued behind us) and mark the edges `inferred`
 * rather than reporting a file against the wrong step as fact.
